* patdiff.exe

: Compare two files (or process a diff read in on stdin) using the
: patience diff algorithm.
: 
: If you don't supply any arguments to patdiff, it will read diff-like
: text from stdin and color it in the normal patdiff way.
: 
: The file ~/.patdiff is used as a config file if it exists.  You can
: write a sample config with the -make-config flag.
