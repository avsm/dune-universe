(** [with_temp_dir f] creates a temporary directory which is fed to [f].  The directory
    is removed after [f] exits. *)
val with_temp_dir : (string -> 'a Deferred.t) -> 'a Deferred.t

(** [within_temp_dir ?links f] creates a temporary directory, $T, and:

    1. Adds $T/bin to the PATH environment variable.
    2. For each [file, `In_path_as, name] in [links], links [file] as $T/bin/[name].
    3. For each [file, `In_temp_as, name] in [links], links [file] as $T/[name].

    It then [cd]s to $T and calls [f].  After [f] exits, it [cd]s back, removes the
    temporary directory, and restores the original PATH. *)

(** [run prog args] creates a child process that runs [prog], with arguments [args], its
    environment extended with [extend_env] and its stdin coming from [stdin].  No
    expansion or escaping is done to [args] or [stdin].  The child process's stdout and
    stderr are captured separately for comparison. *)

(** [system ?stdin cmd] creates a child process that runs [/bin/sh], with arguments
    ["-c"; cmd] and its stdin coming from [stdin]. The child process's stdout and stderr
    are captured separately for comparison. Unlike with [Unix.system], the child shell's
    stdin is never a tty, even if the stdin of this process is a tty, and the child
    shell's stderr is never copied to this process's stderr. *)

(** [show_raise' ?hide_positions ?rest f] calls [f ()] and prints either the exception
    raised by [f] or "did not raise".  [show_raise'] ignores the result of [f] so that one
    doesn't have to put an [ignore] inside [f].  [~hide_positions] operates as in
    [print_s], to make output less fragile.  Once a result is returned, the rest of the
    errors are printed to stdout. *)

    produce a deferred result. *)

    deferred result. *)

(** We export [Expect_test_config] so that the [%expect] syntax uses Async, to prevent a
    confusing situation in which one is using [Expect_test_helpers] functions, which
    expect Async to be running, but Async isn't running.  Also, we override
    [Expect_test_config.run f] so that, if [f ()] raises, [run] prints the exception
    rather than raising.  Printing works better with the expect-test workflow than an
    unhandled exception, because there is a [.corrected] file that one can accept and
    inspect. *)
